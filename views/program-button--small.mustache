        <h3>Web Science</h3>
        <p>The Majors Software Science and Web Science are formally embedded in the Bachelor program Computer Science and Engineering (in Dutch: Technische Informatica). Consequently, after completing one of these Majors, you will receive the Bachelor's degree certificate in Computer Science and Engineering.<br/>As of September 2017 Software Science and Web Science will be merged into the Computer Science and Engineering major. With electives students can still choose profiles that are similar to the current majors Web Science and Software Science so the program is very divers and broad.<br/>The overall objective of the Bachelor program is to train and educate young professionals who are able to progress into an appropriate Masterâ€™s program and/or are prepared to embark upon a professional career in the field of Software Science or Web Science.<br/>Students are therefore expected to:<br/>acquire cognitive skills relating to computer science and engineering<br/>acquire practical capabilities and skills relating to software design (the Web Science major focuses on complex internet-based applications, while the Software<br/>Science major is more concerned with technical applications)<br/>acquire professional and generic academic skills</p>
