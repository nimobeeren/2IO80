                        The world runs on software nowadays, but sometimes it runs in the wrong direction. Just imagine what could happen if level crossing barriers failed to close in good time or if the power failed as a result of a software fault. Why do so many projects on automation fail, why is it so complicated to design or maintain a large software system? Why are some apps an instant success and others not, what is needed for new web services to emerge? <br/> In this major you will learn the basic principles and methods to develop (large) software systems and web services that are reliable, efficient and maintainable. This is something that goes beyond writing computer programs. You will learn how to take the user perspective into account. You will be able to reason about the correctness and efficiency of programs in a scientific way, by using formal mathematical methods. You will know how to develop further the technology and software that underlies the internet. <br/> You will develop knowledge and skills that you can enjoy for the rest of your career and that will therefore not immediately become obsolete whenever a new programming language or development environment is introduced. <br/> In addition to expanding your knowledge and skills, you also learn how to apply all of these in order to solve specific problems. We will teach you how to do this by means of Design-Based Learning, known as the DBL projects. These involve working in a team of fellow students on projects. In the first year you will develop a user-friendly web portal. In the second year you can choose one out of four projects: develop an embedded system, or a brand new app, or an information system or a new efficient algorithm for a specific problem. In the third year, your final project will be a special DBL where you develop a software system (or improve an existing one) on request of a company.
